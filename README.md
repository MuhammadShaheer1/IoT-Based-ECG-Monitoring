# IoT-Based-ECG-Monitoring

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a remote monitoring system for 
electrocardiography (ECG) using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system will allow patients to 
monitor their ECG remotely, with the data being transmitted to a healthcare provider for analysis. This 
will allow patients to receive timely medical attention and avoid unnecessary hospital visits.

## Problem Statement

Patients with cardiovascular conditions often require frequent monitoring of their ECG to ensure that their 
condition is stable. However, traditional ECG monitoring methods can be inconvenient and time-consuming, as patients may need to visit a healthcare facility to have their ECG monitored. This can be 
particularly challenging for patients who live in remote or rural areas, or who have mobility issues.

## Our Work

The IOT Based ECG Monitoring system has demonstrated its ability to remotely monitor and transmit ECG 
data, providing a convenient and effective solution for patients with cardiovascular conditions. In the 
future, the system could be improved by incorporating additional features such as alerts for abnormal 
ECG readings and integration with other medical devices and sensors, such as blood pressure monitors or 
oxygen saturation monitors. Additionally, the system could be made more user-friendly by developing a 
mobile app that allows patients to easily access and view their ECG data. Overall, the IOT Based ECG 
Monitoring system has the potential to greatly improve the quality of care for patients with cardiovascular 
conditions, while also reducing the burden on the healthcare system by reducing unnecessary hospital 
visits.
